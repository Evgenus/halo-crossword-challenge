# Halo Crossword Coding Challenge

Hello, and thank you for taking the Halo Developer Coding Challenge!  This
challenge is to implement a crossword puzzle solver.  Specifically, the inputs
will be:
    - An Empty Crossword Board
    - A Set of Words
And the output should be:
    - A Valid Solution to the Empty Crossword Puzzle, using the Given Set of Words

There is one sample input in the crossword.py file. Latency should be taken into
account.  Readability should also be taken into account.  While not required,
please feel free to use classes and tests to help structure your solver.  Please use
python version 2.7, as that is the version that our servers are running.

If you have any questions, please consult your recruiter.

Best,
The Halo Team
